When you lose fifty pounds (60 down, 70 to go...) and your shape is naturally curvy, you want to SEE those curves you used to have. Something about the longer shape on this one drew me in - and I'm glad I chose it. I got the XXL because I wanted a little extra space all around for layering underneath (got that, on the body). But the problem with nearly everything I ever bought when I was very large and now, still sometimes, as I scale down, is when clothing manufacturers upsize a garment they don't seem to understand they cannot bypass the armhole/sleeve area. If a person is overweight across the chest you have to know you're going to have to cut a roomier garment there AND through the armholes/arms, as well. With my weight loss (currently hovering around 197 lbs/size 16), I can wear the coat without another layer underneath. It's going to be snug with a fitted hoodie, however. And there's no way the armholes wouldn't have been impossible (XXL, remember) at 250 lbs.At any rate, at under 200lbs NOW this is a beautiful coat, with a flattering mid-thigh length and slight princess fit/flare. Details I thought might be distracting (the cuff bands) are actually quite lovely. I hope this coat is still here when I'm smaller because it's already slimming and kind of \"hot.\" But if I were a size 8 it would REALLY look smashing!Just don't be surprised if the armholes kill the deal if you're bigger than a size 16.

This past weekend I got the chance to take the pack out for the first time - to Mount Whitney. I could fit a lot of stuff into the pack and it felt really comfortable when adjusted correctly. My big issue is that there is a terrible squeak that comes from the shoulder straps and the hip-belt with every step. It is super distracting and become downright annoying after a while - especially as you just want to hike in the wilderness with no annoying sounds. I checked out reviews after I got back and it turns out that this pack has always had an issue with squeaking. There is a post by an REI rep from 2018, where they claim that they fixed the issue with the packs from that year onwards. However, going by my experience and reading other reviews, it seems they have not fixed the issue ... or it is a QC issue. Some folks don't seem to have this problem.If you buy one, then just make sure you load it up as you would for your camping trip and walk around a bit to ensure that you don't have the squeak. For me personally, Osprey has had enough time to work on this, but it seems they haven't been able to address this issue. For $270 before taxes, this pack is expensive - everything about it screams quality, other than this squeak.

The first trip I took felt awful because I had the weight distributed all wrong-- heavy stuff (tent) hanging off the bottom, stuff strapped to the outside, and 1.5L nalgenes stuffed into the side pockets. After shedding an unnecessary 15 lbs and redistributing the load, my joy factor doubled.WARNING: I have a 33/34\" waist. The belt is actually TOO BIG for me on the Large sized pack. I'm going to need to gain some weight, lolz, or find a way to buffer my hips. Two days into a backpacking trip, and the Atmos AG 65 was slipping down my backside.

When you put a full water bag in the main compartment it reduces the amount of volume for other things. The bed roll straps are a bit short and if it rains the waterproof cover sold separately will not cover your bed roll. I wound up having to carry my bedroll by hand in the rain as the straps are hidden by the cover. I guess it's ok if the bedroll get's soaked (sarcasm). Furthermore with the rain cover on it is difficult to get the pack on as you need to thread your arms through the straps but not get hung up in the waterproof cover. If you are by yourself this can be a bit of a challenge. It can also be difficult to get the side strap compartments to unfold with the rain cover on. I wound up just foregoing using the waist belt when it was raining. I personally would recommend a poncho that will cover the whole setup if you expect to encounter rain. You'll be more comfortable and all your stuff will remain dry.The plus side is that this was a very comfortable pack to wear when dry and my shoulders never became too sore over the course of the day.

It\u2019s more of a less-than-forty purchase IMHO. I cannot get pics to upload but the straps are not very padded, the lift strap at the top is not that substantial and it\u2019s just overall not that big.I had trouble loading a Canon body with a 150-600 lens in the bottom compartment in such a manner that I could use the side-load zip to grab it. No other place to store the big glass, so it would have to be the one mounted on the camera while it\u2019s in the pack. Not great, but not the worst thing either.With the body, 150-600mm lens, the Canon kit lens and a 16-35mm lens, the pack was pretty full. Room for a flash and a few sundries but nothing more. I can\u2019t imagine adding a 15\u201d laptop to the weight and finding this at all comfortable to carry. It wasn\u2019t that comfortable with those items I listed above.The major flaw, however, IMO is the lack of any sort of strap to slide it onto the telescopic handle of luggage. I can\u2019t even remember the last backpack I bought that doesn\u2019t have this feature and I was flabbergasted to find it missing when I did a dry run in the house with the pack and suitcase.

Plenty of access points and space."}, {"rating": 5, "title": "Great product!", "review": "Great product, great seller."}, {"rating": 5, "title": "Perfect for the outdoorsman or professional photographer", "review": "Now, I'm no professional photographer, but I do own a Canon 30D with a 200mm Tamron lens, a 50mm lens, a 35mm Canon A1 film camera with a lens on it, and two other lenses for it as well. This backpack holds all of them perfectly with extra space for my film autowinder, extra rolls of film, and other extra little gear like tripod attachments, camera straps, and remotes. This thing is incredible. I got this backpack because I was tired of having camera equipment lying around because it wouldn't fit in my smaller bag. I wanted to be able to store everything in one spot and be able to know where everything is. I also wanted a backpack I can grow into, so I needed one with extra space for when I upgrade my camera body and buy additional lenses. This has everything and more.I had spinal fusion surgery a little under 5 years ago to correct scoliosis and I have 15 of my vertebrae fused. Ever since then, finding a backpack that doesn't cause me serious amounts of back pain has been a challenge, which sucks because I'm an avid hiker and carry heavy gear on those hikes. Because of the ability to adjust the tops of the straps on the backpack, as well as there being a chest strap and waist belt, I can have my backpack fully loaded, weighing well over 15 pounds, and I get zero back pain. Everything is fully adjustible, which is a dream. I also get a lot of neck pain because it is pretty much the only part of my spine I can move and bend, and there is always a lot of tension there. The included caribiner straps on the shoulder straps are amazing! I hook my film camera to it and it takes the weight off of my neck, which eliminates the need for a strap for it all together. I never would have thought of ever wanting something like that, but it was such a smart move.The laptop pocket is a little bit cramped when fully loaded, even for my 13 inch 2022 Macbook Air, which is already pretty slim, however I love the secrecy of where it's located and how to access it. The extra storage compartments within the backpack are amazing too, I keep extra Canon A1 batteries, film, and my CF card reader in those compartments.Though I haven't traveled with it just yet, I can already tell it will replace my regular backpack on more hiking centric trips. I can put both my film and digital cameras in the bottom compartment, and remove the top padding to put toiletries, clothes, and other electronic items in there. I think it would be too big to put under the seat on a plane, however it might on a bigger plane. If you're American, I definitely recommend having TSA pre-check so you don't have to unload this entire bag on the conveyer belt when in the security line, haha.The tripod slots on the side are incredibly smart. You can either put the legs into the cup holder itself, or there's a little pouch that comes out of the waist belt that can also hold the tripod legs. There are three ways of strapping it in that way, one clip strap at the top, and two adjustible ones at the middle and bottom. If you configure it correctly, you could also fit a gimble, gorilla pod, and even a drone on the side of this backpack. This configuration is on both sides of the backpack too, which is great if you want a gimble and a tripod, or a tripod and a drone, or anything you can think of.I haven't needed the extra waist bag, but it can hold an additional camera body plus a lens or two in it. It's great if you need the space, but I think it's a little bit extra for what I need the backpack for.Overall, this backpack is amazing quality and has amazing back support. I anticipate having no issues traveling with this, and it hold all of my equipment and then some. I highly recommend it for the photographer hobbyist, avid nature photographer, professionals, or anybody who just loves a good backpack (myself included). I didn't know a hybrid hiking / camera bag existed, but now I can reserve my 15L hiking backpack, with no padding for my camera (which I would literally just throw in there with a hoodie around it as padding), as a camping bag and just use this, which will keep my camera protected from myself and the elements. This thing also comes with a rain cover to make it fully waterproof. If you are considering other bags as an option, don't.

But not toward the top.100-500 lens attached - with ring and hood (reversed). Full sized binocular, travel CPAP and related items and back up battery. One additional lens - 24mm with EF adapter attached. Batteries, charger, cables and extension cord. Because of the CPAP components I would not be able to add a laptop but I do not travel with one. Maybe room left for small snacks and water bottle (slim) will fit. All this without the water bottle sure looks good for under seat stowage if required. It is heavy - 20lbs. with this load. If you travel frequently this may stress the bag and you may want to go to a higher quality level but the bag looks pretty well put together but I will be pushing it.

I wanted to try it, and I saw this one, and it was reasonably priced, so I only thought twice before purchasing. This steamer would be a good investment for people like me who do their laundry to ensure few wrinkles; however, no matter how hard you try, you will always have a wrinkle here and there. And this steamer is small but works miracles when it comes to those tiny wrinkles. It is travel friendly, easy to store, and compact. I am satisfied with the purchase because I knew it was something other than what I would use daily. There are instances when a minor crease in my clothing makes me lazy about getting out the iron and performing all that extra work. I did not need it for anything significant, in other words.I was excited to try it when it arrived, so I did. At first, I was frightened because there did not appear to be any steam coming out, but after 3 minutes, I saw smoke, so I recommend giving it some time after being plugged in to get it operating. I had never used a steamer before and was highly pleased. It contains enough water to complete at least one outfit. To avoid water spurting out, don't fill it up. Be cautioned not to put your hands or skin too close to the blue nozzle because this machine part gets hot. Despite being portable and simple, I tried a steamer because it doesn't leave wrinkles and lines like an iron. And just as expected, the steam did wonders for me in removing wrinkles. I also used the included brush, which worked equally effectively both ways. Although it works wonders, I would not suggest it to someone who plans to use it frequently because it is time-consuming and doesn't work as well on oversized clothing. This isn't to say that it doesn't work, just that you must review it a few times to get it to look exactly right. However, this is ideal if you're looking for something inexpensive, convenient for storage, and simple to use. Remember that it works best on smaller clothes because it will take less water, and you can get a lot done with one full cup. If you wanted to steam more than one piece of clothing at a time, you would have to stop often, turn the machine off, and let it cool down for a few minutes before adding more water and plugging it back in, and then wait another three minutes for the steam to resume. It has undoubtedly been put to use and has been helpful on numerous occasions. Getting wrinkle-free clothing has become necessary for travel and daily life. The functionality of this product is excellent, given its size and cost.\u00a0 The product heats up quickly and is a perfectly manageable size. Use filtered or purified water to avoid limescale buildup that could damage equipment and stain garments. Although it removes wrinkles rapidly, it cannot replace ironing. The product is excellent overall, and I suggest it unless you plan to use it frequently for formal attire because doing so requires a lot of time. But don't let it deter you from purchasing it. I'm sure you will love it as much as I do and will use it extensively. People like me who take their time with their laundry to ensure minimal wrinkles would benefit from investing in this steamer.

In theory this thing works but as water boils, the heat plate is too close to the top opening, the water ended up boiling over top openings.A longer nozzle head, a bigger chamber or a lower max line probably would have make this work a little longer and safer.

This one had over 90k reviews- mostly positive- so I figured I\u2019d grab it while it was on sale.It arrived same day, it was simple to \u201cput together\u201d and use immediately. It is very lightweight and I\u2019d say takes up as much space as a classic blow dryer if I were to pack it in a suitcase/overnight bag.It took a bit to heat up, my larger one had a much bigger water tank and I feel like it took about 30s to heat up. This little guy has like a cup of water in its tank and it probably took closer to a minute to boil the water. Not a big deal just something I noticed.The steam comes out with some force so I was impressed with that-my other steamer just seemed to allow the steam to just float out of the hose attachment.I used this steamer on 2 satin feeling camisoles that where just purchased and taken out of the packaging so they were in pretty bad shape with wrinkles and fold marks. This steamer did a pretty good job at removing all of the wrinkles in 1-3 passes. The biggest negative for me was that it sputters water a bit. I had this issues with my older steamer so it\u2019s not a huge deal breaker, and so far I have had 0 issues with water stains but I can imagine on very delicate materials it could be bad. I also didn\u2019t experience these droplets spilling onto my skin but the water is at boiling point so I would be careful.Overall for the sale price of 22$, I\u2019m willing to keep this little guy and use it as my travel steamer.

I liked that I could match the color of the arm to the backs of the monitors, but black is also available.My monitors are fairly light, and I have not had any trouble getting the arms to stay in place. There is a convenient holder for the Allen (hex) wrenches that the mount comes with, which is a nice feature. It also comes with guides for cables.Like most flexible systems like this, I have a problem getting the monitors to align perfectly in the middle. I've resorted to strapping 3/4 inch velcro around the the inside/touching edges of the monitors - it forces them into vertical alignment and closes the gap that would otherwise allow sunlight through my windows to be really distracting. If you have super nice monitors that have small (or absent) bevels, something like that wouldn't work well (although I've seen other hacks online that could help).The stand comes with the C clamp mount that you can screw on; there's a layer of rubber padding to reduce the possibility of damaging the finish of your desk. There's also an option to bolt the whole system onto a solid wood surface if your desk doesn't have a ledge large enough for the clamp. I would never... but your mileage may vary.In retrospect, since I don't rotate my monitors to vertical positions, I'd rather have something where the mounts don't rotate, so will always hold the monitors perfectly even with each other, but I'm pretty happy with this system."}, {"rating": 4, "title": "Works well after the painful assembly", "review": "It took forever to assemble, I spent about 15 minutes on one screw just to find out it was misaligned.

The mount does what the listing says, it's useable, but it has a lot of design flaws that prevent me from really liking it.The problems began with assembly. I have a desk with a tiered shelf and the shelf is what I needed to attach the mount to. I had a solid 5-6 inches to work with and the mounting clamp and screw that holds it to the desk was far too longto fit in place. I wound up having to improvise with the design of the clamp and the spacers provided to get it to fit my desk.That alone wasn't a major issue, and more on me than the manufacturer, but my biggest gripe with this mount are the brackets that actually hold the monitors to the mounting arms: They are far too loose. In the package you get a set of A6 and A4 screws, my monitors need A4's. The A6 screws are all metal and are fine. The A4's on the other hand are thumb-tightening screws, which means they have a plastic cap attached at the end for easy tightening. In order to secure the mounting plate I have to really tighten these screws. Unfortunately due to the incredibly cheap plastic the caps are made out of the hole for screwdrivers will immediately strip if you apply any significant amount of tightening force to it. If you plan on using this mount, get your own all-metal A4 screws to fix the plates on. (Also of note, at least two of the hex bolts I received with the hardware were also stripped to some extent)Of course, the plates themselves are also an issue, they are too loose and don't fit securely enough. They do not slot tightly into the arm nor do they include a tool to completely tighten the nuts that affix the plates to the arm. This results in monitors that are loose enough that they noticeably wobble if you lightly bump the desk or even type too hard.That being said, I built the mount and attached the monitors anyway out of stubbornness as I was committed and had already put in the effort. Overall, the mount looks fine, but the arms to move them are more stiff than I'd like, making them difficult to move at times, and with the design if you need to push them back you'll have to make sure you have some room between the back of your desk and any walls behind it to avoid scratching them.Also included in the package are some cable management clips that fit onto the mount's arms and shaft, which are a nice little addition, however like the mounting plates they also fit pretty loosely onto the arms and move way too easily once attached. If you have zip-ties or some other fastener use those instead for cleaner cables.Overall, you get what you pay for, and I can't say I recommend the product. If you want the cheapest possible mount that actually functions, but has noticeable issues, sure. However, if you want a proper mount it would be worth it to pay out a little more for something more expensive, higher-quality, and built to more precise tolerances."}, {"rating": 5, "title": "Excellent value dual desk monitor", "review": "I use one at my office and one in my home office.No chance you find a better dual monitor stand for $35!"}, {"rating": 5, "title": "Perfect!", "review": "Easy to install.

I wanted something that had some advanced features to help me as a new flyer and took amazing Video\\Photos. This delivers on all points! Epic Photos and epic video, follow a subject mode, The ultimate FLYING cameraman. I got some flight time in and got a little practice. My backyard is basically a fairy tale forest in western PA, complete with a stream I can watch the animals drink from. So there were no shortage of amazing shots to take or my wife could live stream from it on hikes. To play around flying in my house to get some fine control skills down a bit I turned off the perimeter safety. Then after the battery was charged I went flying farther outside for some epic shots. Forgetting I turned off the perimeter warnings I got too close to a tree and the unthinkable happened. Yeah only careless people get their drones stuck in a tree that could NEVER happen to me right? right.... :(.WRONG! I had this amazing piece of technology for all of 1 day and crashed it amazingly good 150 feet up into a tree. I finally located the exact tree with the last vestiges of my battery life with the very useful feature of it beeping and flashing. Which was still difficult through the dense foliage. (note to self invest in a self powered strobe and a bright orange skin or sticker after I retrieve the drone.). The problem with this particular tree is on the civilization side between any route in about 15 ft away from said tree is a power line, the other direction is dense bramble filled forest. This particular tree also doesn't have any branches lower than 30 ft up, Ruh Roh. I spend about 8 hours for a week straight trying to come up with ideas to knock it down.I tried Fish sticks (they are light semi bendy poles used to fish wire through walls if you are unfamiliar.), I tries throwing object at it, (Way too high up.) I researched Climbing gear but decided it was too high a risk of getting hurt. AHA! The perfect plan, buy a mavic Air 1tie fishing line and a hook around it, hook the stuck Mavic Air 2 and boom, no more stuck Drone. Then sell the extra one. So I did Just that, errr tried just that anyway.I amazingly hooked the first drone and the plan was working great, the first was really stuck though so I kicked up the throttle to full speed more with a payload. then.... the hook broken the second drone flipped over and yes you guessed it got stuck in the tree also. So here I am standing in the forest with about $1500 in a tree behind my house. Well that went south fast.So after more extensive research I make kind of a primitive pipe slingshot spear gun thing that flings a dowel that has fishing line attached and a fishing reel over the branch, then you tie stronger rope to the fishing line and use the line to pull the stronger rope over the branch, then tie off one and and pull hard back and forth till you can shake it loose. Success getting the Second Mavic air 1 out of the tree and back to safety! At this point I am about 3 weeks in and a lot of time in this forest. 4 more days with the slingshot thing and no luck getting the first one out.My wife makes an ultimatum, No more trips into the forest getting the drone while she worries or there will be no more wife. I am very fortunate and have married the woman of my dreams and my soulmate! So as much as it CRUSHED my spirit to do so I agreed because I love her. It is not in my nature to give up but for her I would do anything. The worst part is I can see the drone in the tree in the winter from my mailbox taunting me.My friend (under close supervision) let me practice and use his Mavic Air 2 which he loves. I got some great shots and lots of practice. Fast forward to Yesterday, (11-19-22) The drone was not in it's usual taunting place and the leaves have pretty much just all fallen now. This requires closer investigation. Could it be true did it finally fall from it's taunting perch? YES IT DID! so this drone has been up there through snow and rain storms quite hot days and everything unprotected for 15 months, on top of that it fell 150 ft to the ground. What kind of shape could it possibly be in? believe it or not AMAZING SHAPE! Except the battery it has discharged so much that the electronics would not allow it to charge anymore, but that was expected. It was a tiny bit scratched up and Dirty, nothing a cleaning couldn't fix. But does anything in it still work through all that weather?Well I borrowed a battery from my friend and shockingly it still works and flies without any issues! I can no longer find my case with the extra propellers or the prop guards I wish I had been using. But hey I still have the rest and it works after all that! I can't think of any more ringing of an endorsement than surviving 15 months in a tree and then a 150 ft fall. So if you want a great very durable Drone that takes amazing videos and picture I would HIGHLY recommend this one.

I hoped Bose might have a secret design that might work for me, but no.So in the last year, I've used them maybe 50 times around the house to not interrupt others with the media I consume.About a month ago, the left earbud developed a constant white noise, regardless of whether I had any audio playing or not. Maybe I would have noticed it sooner, but the noise canceling is VERY good and I still like to hear my surroundings and (this was a large disappointment) the left ear cannot be utilized independently from the right. Meaning, I can't use the left without the right, but the right can be used without the left, so with the aforementioned superior noise canceling and my desire to be cognizant of my surroundings, the left rarely got used.Then, the charging port stopped working. I'm not sure why, the case doesn't see much abuse because I don't use the product outside of my house since I can't trust them to stay in my ear. (Again, I'm sure that's more of an issue with my ears than a product design problem)."}, {"rating": 1, "title": "Not new - can\u2019t pair", "review": "The earbuds I received are not new.

If you want a long lasting product, look elsewhere!"}, {"rating": 2, "title": "Doesn't day on ears", "review": "It's a shame, when these work they work. The noise canceling is amazing and the sound quality is great!Now if only they actually stayed on yout ears. That's right. They fall of for any little movement. To think these are sold as sport headphones. Nope they fall off before ypu even start moving sometimes. Best part, Adjusting them back into your ear pauses the music.Try harder Bose. (And yes I've tried every rubber ear piece available)If only I could get a refund."}, {"rating": 1, "title": "Not worth 200", "review": "You are unable to use just 1 ear bud you must wear both. Music sounds great but call quality is unleveled.

While on a call, numerous people have commented about the low quality of the sound, saying it is distant, noisy, and tinny (all high end). Even after attempting to cancel noise, adjust settings, it's likely the mic is substandard.The good....amazing for songs and movies. Bass is amazing. Cancels noise well."}]}
